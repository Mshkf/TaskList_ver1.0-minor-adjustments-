# TaskList_ver1.0
This console app just shows that i can do such app.
Some features:
1. Can add, print, edit, delete tasks.
2. Have option to terminate programm by entering "end" after succesful input of a task.
3. I think that this kind of output is fancy.

4. Maybe someday i will add a possibility to save your tasklist as JSON file. But not yet...
5. Enjoy!!!

How to use it:

First time you launch this app you will see this little menu:

Here you can choose an option you want. But in case there is no tasks any option except "end" and "add" will work properly*.

After you type "add" keyword you need to input priority(case insesitive), date, time and task itself in this order

If you try to add an empty task task will not be added and message about your empty task will be displayed.

When task is succesfully typed in you can edit it, print all the tasks you input or delete any task you want.

Edititng tasks:

First you need to type "edit" keyword. Then choose task from the list. After that you need to choose which field you want to change. Change it.

Deleting tasks:

First you need to type "delete" keyword. Then choose task from the list. Delete it.


*in case you want to know what happens if you try to print empty task list

P.S.
In output table P stands for Priority and D for Due Tag. So it actually depends on your date.
