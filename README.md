# TaskList_ver1.0
This console app just shows that i can do such app.
Some features:
1. Can add, print, edit, delete tasks.
2. Have option to terminate programm by entering "end" after succesful input of a task.
3. I think that this kind of output is fancy.

4. Maybe someday i will add a possibility to save your tasklist as JSON file. But not yet...
5. Enjoy!!!

P.S.
In output table P stands for Priority and D for Due Tag. So it actually depends on your date.
